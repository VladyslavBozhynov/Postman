# Postman
This repository includes two Postman collections with requests to a remote server.
The First_Collection contains three simple requests (two with the GET method and one with the POST method) that do not require a token.
The second collection (HomeWork) contains 11 requests, all of which use the POST method and require a token. The global environment is used to store and use variables, including the server's host, token, and others. Key-values pairs in these requests are send using form-data or raw modes. Almost all requests include tests and some of the requests were completely written in the "Tests" tab.
